    "__D1.__ _(2 points)_ In this module, you will be working on a Jupyter Notebook as the input data. In Module A of Assignment Group 1, we worked on the script of the [Seinfeld Chronicles dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles). Due to a mistake, we have printed the scripts 50 times. As a result, the generated output is very large and it does not allow us to open the notebook. If we cannot open the notebook, we won't be able to recover the code we've written before the problematic line of code. As a fix, in this module we are going to recover a Jupyter Notebook by removing the undesired `outputs` and save the notebook with a new name. Therefore, the first thing to know is the format of a Jupyter Notebook. As you noticed, the Jupyter Notebooks' names end with `.ipynb`. But, what is the format of a Jupyter Notebook as a data type, .e.g., CSV, XML, HTML, etc.? "
